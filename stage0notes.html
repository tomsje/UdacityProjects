<h1>Overview of the internet</h1>
<h3>What happens when you open a web page?</h3>

<p>
A webpage is a text document written in HTML. 
When you enter a web address or URL in your web browser internet connects you to the webservers where the documents live.  
Your Computer connects to the internet using http to contact web servers.  
Http is the language that the internet communicates to and from your computer to the webserver. 
Web browsers read the HTML, interpret and display the content. This video covers it much better than I can!

<h1>Introduction to HTML</h1>
<h3>What is a webpage?</h3>
<p>
A web page is a text document written in  HTML. HTML stands for <em><b>Hyper Text Markup Language</b></em>.  
The text or content is displayed as specified by the “markup” or the formatting you see.<br> Content can be anything from text to images or links to other pages.
</p>

<h3>Computers <b>ARE</b> stupid <em>beware!</em></h3>
<p>
Computers are completely literal and are easily confused if the syntax is incorrect. 
Pay close attention to syntax to avoid unexpected behavior. 
Remember that it will do exactly you say, so say it correctly!<br>


Don't worry Programmers can’t remember everything if you forget something - look it up.   It is very easy to lookup syntax on the internet. 
Try searching on <a href = "http://www.google.com" > Google.com</a>. <br>

<h3>HTML vocabulary to become familiar with: Tags and Elements</h3>  
<p>
Tag = These are contained between a less than " &lt; "and greater than " &gt; " symbols. 
There is usually an open and close. The close tag has a  forward slash /  for example: &lt; p&gt;  Element &lt; /p&gt;  If a tag does not need a close it is called a void tag. <br>

Element  = Everything inside the opening and closing tags <br>

Attribute  = A property of an element.  For example the anchor tag has the property href which you assign a link to. <br>
</p>


<h3>Inline and block elements</h3>
<p> 
Block elements are special because you are adding something like an invisible box around the element. It keeps the elements together in a grou.
If you add this type of tag in the middle of a sentence you can see the buffer around it. 
An example of a block is the paragraph tag &lt;p&gt;   example of other block tags would be div and form. 
An example of inline is <br> which adds exactly on newline where it is. Also img,a, span are also inline. 
<br>
This is a simple sentence with a <P>block</P> paragraph tag around the word block.<br>
